Connect MVP SRS
Okay, here's a draft of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the "Connect" app, based on our previous conversations and the mock-up you provided. This is a starting point, and you'll need to fill in the details specific to your project:
Software Requirements Specification: Connect App
1. Introduction
•	1.1 Purpose:
o	This document specifies the requirements for the "Connect" application, a mobile/web app designed to help users manage and track interactions with their contacts, facilitating stronger relationships and better record-keeping.

o	This document covers the functional, non-functional, and interface requirements for the Connect app.
•	1.3 Intended Audience:
o	This document is intended for the development team, testers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the Connect app project.
2. Overall Description
•	2.1 Product Perspective:
o	Connect is a standalone application that provides a centralized hub for contact management, communication, and activity logging. It aims to provide a more organized and personal alternative to standard contact lists and scattered communication methods.
•	2.2 Product Functions:
o	Contact Profile Management (create, read, update, delete)
o	Messaging (separate and all messages views)
o	Journal/Activity Log
o	Keyword Search
•	2.3 User Characteristics:
o	Professionals (sales, recruiting, consulting) who rely on relationship building.
o	Project managers tracking team interactions.
o	Individuals seeking better relationship management.
o	Tech-literate users comfortable with mobile apps.
•	2.4 Operating Environment:
o	Mobile:
	iOS (latest 3 versions)
	Android (latest 3 versions)
o	Web:
	Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
o	Connectivity: Requires internet connectivity for most functionalities. Offline access for viewing previously loaded contact information may be considered.
•	2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:
o	Data Privacy: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations.
o	Security: Secure storage of user data and secure communication.
o	Scalability: The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users and contacts.
o	Technology Stack: [To be determined based on your choices - e.g., React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase]
